# Initial design and strategy brainstorm

Strategy
- need to store cans vertically
- need to pick up more than one can at a time
- pass the drop-off twice
- start with designing a single robot, then duplicate it twice to make the other robots

Sketches
1) Clamp: this design incorporated two flat panels to clamp a can and a hinge to orient the can vertically.

2) Claw: this was a more traditional claw design with a wristlike feature to allow the can to rotate.

3) Conveyor belt: the conveyor belt would push a can up into the robot to store, and then there would be a dropoff feature for the can to fall out from the other side once the robot was at the return vehicle

4) Garbage truck: this design used a sweeping motion to collect a can from the side of the robot onto a platform which would then rise up and store the can in the robot
