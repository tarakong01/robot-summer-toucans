# Prototyping

#### Reservoir prototypes (top row, left to right):
- Rotating reservoir to drop cans off at the return vehicle. Designed such that one can occupies the space at a time, and once dropped off, the next stored can  rolls into the now vacant space
- A can is dropped into the top of a tall reservoir, which orients it vertically as it falls, then is pushed out of the way at the bottom, down the ramp so the next can can be dropped into the reservoir
- Three specified storage compartments, which the robot is programmed to place cans into one at a time. At the return vehicle, the bottom platform is lifted out of the way, such that the cans fall into the return vehicle all together

#### Claw prototypes (bottom row, left to right):
- Clamp-style claw with two flat, wide panels reinforced with rubber bands for maximum grip and contact area
- Pulley and platform mechanism. At the top, can would be deposited into a reservoir for storage
- Hinged claw design, reinforced with rubber bands. Thin claws allow for grabbing cans at many orientations. Claw is attached to a moving arm and swivelling base
- Wristlike claw design, which rotates about its axis. Takes up less space than hinged claw, but is more complex to build and actuate.
- Double-taloned claw, very similar to hinged claw but with an additional front claw for stronger grip. Heavier and bulkier as a result.

The Toucan was our "final" design - of course, tweaks and alterations were made continuously throughout our testing, but this was the design that we chose to base our robots off of. The main features of this design are:
- the flapper and hopper, which spins to sweep cans into the collection area and orients them in the desired position for the claw to grab them,
- the claw/arm/swivel, which consists of a stationary flat panel and a thin moving claw/talon to grab the can, a moving arm to lift the can up and vertical, and a swivel base to relocate the can above one of the three reservoir positions,
- and the reservoir, which stores up to 3 cans in preset positions. Once at the return vehicle, the robot will line up next to it and lift the platform which the cans are resting upon, thus dropping the cans into the return vehicle all at the same time.
