# Prototyping

#### Reservoir prototypes (top row, left to right):
- Rotating reservoir to drop cans off at the return vehicle. Designed such that one can occupies the space at a time, and once dropped off, the next stored can  rolls into the now vacant space
- A can is dropped into the top of a tall reservoir, which orients it vertically as it falls, then is pushed out of the way at the bottom, down the ramp so the next can can be dropped into the reservoir
- Three specified storage compartments, which the robot is programmed to place cans into one at a time. At the return vehicle, the bottom platform is lifted out of the way, such that the cans fall into the return vehicle all together

#### Claw prototypes (bottom row, left to right):
- Clamp-style claw with two flat, wide panels reinforced with rubber bands for maximum grip and contact area
- Pulley and platform mechanism. At the top, can would be deposited into a reservoir for storage
- Hinged claw design, reinforced with rubber bands. Thin claws allow for grabbing cans at many orientations. Claw is attached to a moving arm and swivelling base
- Wristlike claw design, which rotates about its axis. Takes up less space than hinged claw, but is more complex to build and actuate.
- Double-taloned claw, very similar to hinged claw but with an additional front claw for stronger grip. Heavier and bulkier as a result.
